# Tidy Tuesday

[`#TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a
tradition in R where every Tuesday, we practice our data analysis skills
on a new “toy” data set.

I analyzed the number of breweries at varies size categoires and found a
jump of very small microbreweries to higher capacity in 2018 and 2019.
