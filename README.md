# Tidy Tuesday

[`#TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a
tradition in R where every Tuesday, we practice our data analysis skills
on a new “toy” data set.

| [analysis](2020-04-14_best-rap-artists.md)

I built a graph of the songs, artists, and critics using Rap song
rankings.

| [analysis](2020-04-07_tour-de-france.md)

There was quite a lot of data and it took me too long to sort through it
all. Next time, I will focus more on asking a single simple question
rather than trying to understand every aspect of the data.

| [analysis](2020-03-31_beer-production.md)

I analyzed the number of breweries at varies size categoires and found a
jump of very small microbreweries to higher capacity in 2018 and 2019.

| [analysis](2020-03-24_traumatic-brain-injury.md)

The data was a bit more limiting because we only had summary statistics
for categorical variables, but I was able to use PCA to identify some
interesting properties of the TBI sustained by the different age groups.

| [analysis](2020-03-10_college-tuition-diversity-and-pay.md)

I tried to do some classic linear modeling and mixed effects modeling,
but the dat didn’t really require it. Still, I got some practice with
this method and read plenty about it online during the process.

| [analysis](2020-03-03_hockey-goals.md)

I got some practice build regression models for count data by building
Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated Poisson regression models
for estimating the effect of various game parameters on the goals scored
by Alex Ovechkin.
