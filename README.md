# Tidy Tuesday

[`#TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a
tradition in R where every Tuesday, we practice our data analysis skills
on a new “toy” data set.

There was quite a lot of data and it took me too long to sort through it
all. Next time, I will focus more on asking a single simple question
rather than trying to understand every aspect of the data.
